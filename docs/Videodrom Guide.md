## Getting Started

### STEP 1: Prep your folders

Organize or categorize your videos into the folders you like. For folders to show as an image, place an image inside the folder and name the image the same as the folder containing it. 

Videodrome supports multiple levels of sub-directories.

### STEP 2: Installation
If you are using Windows you can download the videodrome.exe file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p5yb14d3/videodrome/master/bin/videodrome-0.2.4.win32.exe), and install it onto your PC. 

If you are using Linux, MacOS, or if you've Python installed on your computer, you can install Videodrome using Python's pip by entering the following commmand in the console.
`$ pip install videodrome`

### STEP 3: Run and Generate

Once installed, open the console window, and key in `videodrome generate <path_to_your_videos>` e.g. `videodrome generate ~\videos`. to start generating the media center for your videos.

### STEP 4: Launching and using the Media Center/Video Gallery

Videodrome will launch the media center in your web browser immediately after generating. You can bookmark it or set it as your homepage on your browser for easy access.

Subsequent access to the page requires no regenerating (unless you wish to add new videos to your folders and would like them to show up on your media center).

## Navigating Videodrome

### Using the Keyboard
Use the arrow keys to navigate. [Enter] to select. [Esc] to go back.

### Using the Mouse
Or you can choose to use the good old mouse. Simply point and click!

### Using the TV remote control
You can also navigate by plugging in this USB-enabled remote control like this one from [Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/REDGO-Portable-Wireless-Keyboard-Multifunctional/dp/B06XPYT52B/)

## Taking your media center with you
Once you have generated your media center, you can take your entire video folder with you to any platform or device that supports a browser with access to your folders.

## Customizing the theme
With a little knowledge of CSS and HTML, you can customize the look and feel of your media center by just changing the files located under the folder themes
